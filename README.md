# Trees

This repository contains a package called `trees`, which provides implementations of various tree data structures. The package contains the following directories:

## lib

This directory contains a single Java file called `TreeNode.java`. This file contains a class that defines the basic structure of a tree node.

## src

This directory contains three Java files: `AVLTree.java`, `TreeVisualizer.java`, and `Main.java`. These files contain the implementation of the AVL tree data structure and an optional visualizer class. The `Main.java` file contains the main class and provides an example of how to use the AVL tree implementation. The program adds at most 30 3-digit numbers to an AVL tree and prints it to the console.

## Makefile

This directory contains a Makefile that can be used to compile and run the program. To run the program, navigate to the `trees` directory and run the `make` command.
