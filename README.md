# Trees

This repository provides implementations of the AVL tree data structure. The package contains the following directories:

## lib

This directory contains a single Java file called `TreeNode.java`. This file contains a class that defines the basic structure of a tree node.

## src

This directory contains three Java files: `AVLTree.java` and `TreeVisualizer.java`. These files contain the implementation of the AVL tree data structure and an optional visualizer class.

The `Main.java` file contains the main class and provides an example of how to use the AVL tree implementation. The program adds at most 30 3-digit numbers to an AVL tree and prints it to the console.
